# Selenium UI Automation (Python)

This folder contains UI test scripts written using Selenium WebDriver with Python.

- All test files are placed in the `tests/` directory
- Uses Python for clear syntax and quick setup
- Ideal for browser automation and regression testing

## Setup

  `pip install selenium`

- Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) and add it to your system path

- Run tests:  
  `python tests/login_test.py`

## Notes

- Scripts follow a simple structure for quick execution
- Suitable for integration into CI/CD pipelines
- Page Object Model (POM) structure can be added as the project grows
